# QuantumOS Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary

QuantumOS represents a paradigm shift in operating system design, incorporating quantum computing principles, advanced parallel processing, embedded artificial intelligence, and revolutionary security mechanisms into a unified system architecture.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Quantum Process Manager (QPM)
**Location**: `/kernel/quantum/`

The Quantum Process Manager revolutionizes traditional process scheduling by applying quantum computing principles:

#### Quantum Superposition Scheduling
- Processes exist in superposition states, allowing probabilistic execution
- Multiple execution paths evaluated simultaneously
- Collapse to optimal state based on system conditions

#### Quantum Entanglement Communication
- Processes can be quantum-entangled for instantaneous state synchronization
- Eliminates traditional IPC overhead
- Maintains coherence across distributed systems
