# QuantumOS - Revolutionary Operating System

## Overview
QuantumOS is a groundbreaking operating system that integrates four revolutionary technologies:

- **Quantum Processes**: Novel process management using quantum computing principles
- **Parallel Processing**: Advanced multi-core and distributed processing engine  
- **Embedded AI**: Built-in artificial intelligence for system optimization and security
- **Security Memory Mapping**: Load-time function mapping to mitigate exploits

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **In Development** - Ground-up design and implementation

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Quantum Process Management
- Quantum superposition for process scheduling
- Entangled process communication
- Quantum error correction for system stability

### 2. Parallel Processing Engine
- NUMA-aware scheduling
- Lock-free data structures
- Adaptive load balancing

### 3. Embedded AI Subsystems
- Real-time threat detection
- Performance optimization
- Predictive resource management

### 4. Security Memory Mapping
- Dynamic function relocation at load time
- Address space layout randomization (ASLR++)
- Hardware-assisted exploit mitigation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Cross-compiler toolchain (i686-elf-gcc)
- NASM assembler
- QEMU for testing
- Quantum simulator (for quantum components)

### Building
```bash
make all          # Build complete system
make quantum      # Build quantum components only
make parallel     # Build parallel engine only
make ai           # Build AI subsystems only
make security     # Build security components only
```

### Testing
```bash
make test         # Run all tests
make qemu         # Boot in QEMU
make quantum-sim  # Test quantum components in simulator
```
